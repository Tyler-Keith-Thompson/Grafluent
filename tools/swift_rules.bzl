"""First-party Swift rule wrappers.

Every first-party `swift_library` / `swift_test` / `swift_binary` loads from here instead of
`@rules_swift//swift:swift.bzl`. The wrappers flip rules_swift features so our
own code is held to a stricter warnings policy than third-party code:

  * `.bazelrc` enables `swift.suppress_warnings` globally, so swiftc gets
    `-suppress-warnings` and dependencies build without noise.
  * Each first-party target disables that feature and enables
    `swift.treat_warnings_as_errors`, so swiftc gets `-warnings-as-errors`
    for our modules.

Net effect: dependencies build quietly, our own warnings fail the build.
